>prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communication systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its **availability**, **integrity**, **authentication**, **confidentiality**, and **nonrepudiation**

>[!info] computer security
>Computer security is made up of the measures and controls that ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability** of information system assets, including hardware, software, firmware and information that is being processed, stored and communicated.

## C.I.A.
The key concepts of security are united under the C.I.A. acronym, and they are:

### confidentiality

>[!info] def
> Preserving **authorised restrictions** on **information access** and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information
> (avoiding unauthorised disclosure of information).

Confidentiality includes two related concepts:
- **data confidentiality** ⟶ assures that private information is not made available to unauthorised individuals
- **privacy** ⟶ assures that individuals control what information related to them can be collected and stored and by whom

#### tools for confidentiality
- **encryption** ⟶ the transformation of information via a secret ("*encryption key*"), so that it can only be read using another secret ("*decryption key*")
- **access control** ⟶ rules and policies that limit access to a confidential piece of information to those systems on a "need to know" basis
-
