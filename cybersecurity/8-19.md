## cryptographic hash function
The purpose of a hash function is to produce a "fingerprint" of a file, message or block of data.

It generates a set of $k$ bits from a set of $L(\geq k)$ bits.
- a hash function is generally non-injective

The result of applying a hash function is called **hash value**, message digest or checksum.

### MAC with one-way hash function

Unlike a MAC, a hash function doesn't take a secret key as input - it is, however, possible to get MACs using hash functions.

There are two approaches to attacking a secure hash function:
- exploit logical weaknesses in the algorithm
- strength
