## classification of malware
Malware is usually classified based on two main factors:
- **how it spreads** to reach the desired targets
- the **actions** or payloads it performs once a target is reached

But it can also be classified by its **independence** and **replication ability**

| classified as       | description                                                                | example              |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **needs a host**    | parasitic code that **requires another legitimate program** to attach to   | viruses              |
| **independent**     | self-contained programs that can **run on their own**                      | worms, trojans, bots |
| **non-replicating** | malware that **does not create copies** of itself or spread automatically. | trojans, spam e-mail |
| **replicating**     | malware that **self-replicates** and spreads to other systems.             | viruses, worms       |

**Propagation mechanisms** include:
- *infection of existing content* by viruses that is subsequently spread to other systems
- *exploitation of software vulnerabilities* by worms or drive-by-downloads (unintended download of software) to allow the malware to replicate
- *social engineering* attacks that convince users to bypass mechanisms to install trojans or to respond to phishing attacks

**Payload actions** performed by malware once it reaches the target include:
- *corruption* of system or data files
- *theft of service* (or making the system a zombie agent as part of a botnet)
- *theft of information*
- hiding its presence in the system
